# Implementation Plan: Export marimo notebook to static Obsidian Markdown

**Branch**: `026-export-notebook-markdown` | **Date**: 2026-06-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/026-export-notebook-markdown/spec.md`

## Summary

Add two commands (and two `.py` file-menu items) that export the active marimo
notebook to a static Obsidian Markdown note: one including source code, one
outputs-only. The HTML is obtained from one of two sources:

1. **Live session (preferred)** — when the notebook is open in a running marimo
   editor, the plugin runs JS inside that editor's `<webview>` to call the edit
   server's `POST /api/export/html`, serializing the **current session state**
   (the user's live widget values) without re-executing the notebook.
2. **CLI fallback** — otherwise it runs `marimo export html` (reusing
   `ServerManager`'s environment resolution), which re-runs the notebook fresh
   (initial widget values). When the notebook is not open in a marimo editor,
   the plugin first shows a warning modal (`export-warning-modal.ts`) so the user
   can proceed with initial values or cancel.

In both cases the plugin reads the `__MARIMO_MOUNT_CONFIG__` object embedded in
the produced HTML to obtain per-cell code (`notebook.cells`) and rendered outputs
(`session.cells`). Outputs are converted to Markdown: `<marimo-tex>` math becomes
Obsidian `$...$`/`$$...$$`, embedded raster images are saved as vault attachments
via Obsidian's attachment API, and interactive `<marimo-ui-element>` widgets and
console output are ignored. The result is written next to the notebook under a
non-colliding name and opened. No headless browser, no external static-HTML tool,
no new runtime dependency.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.8 (ES modules), bundled with esbuild to `main.js`; runtime is Obsidian Desktop on Electron (Node + Chromium).

**Primary Dependencies**: Obsidian API (`Vault`, `FileManager`, `Notice`, `Plugin`, `TFile`, `<webview>.executeJavaScript`); Node `child_process` (already used via `ServerManager.runCapture`), `fs`, `path`. The live export reuses the existing Electron `<webview>` injection path in `editor-view.ts` (no new Electron surface). No new npm runtime dependency — HTML→Markdown conversion is a small in-house converter (see research.md). All Node/Electron/Obsidian modules stay in the esbuild `external` list. Minimum Obsidian version is 1.5.7 (`FileManager.getAvailablePathForAttachment`).

**Storage**: Vault filesystem only — writes one `.md` file plus image attachments; reads/writes a temporary `.html` file that is always deleted.

**Testing**: Node built-in flow via `npm test` (`tests/run-tests.mjs` bundles `*.test.ts` with esbuild and runs `node --test`); Obsidian API is stubbed in `tests/stubs/obsidian.ts`. New pure modules (config extraction, HTML→Markdown, output→Markdown) are unit-tested with fixtures captured from real `marimo export html` output.

**Target Platform**: Obsidian Desktop (macOS/Windows/Linux). Desktop-only per Constitution II.

**Project Type**: Single-project Obsidian plugin (`src/` → `main.js`).

**Performance Goals**: Interactive, single-notebook, on-demand export. No throughput target; export of a typical notebook completes in the time `marimo export html` itself takes (seconds). UI must not block beyond the export subprocess.

**Constraints**: No new user-facing settings; no selection modal during export (FR-015/FR-016). Never overwrite an existing file (FR-011). Always delete the temp HTML on success and failure (FR-013/FR-014). Constitution VI: every new string/number literal goes in `src/constants.ts`. Tabs for indentation.

**Scale/Scope**: ~2 new source modules + wiring in `main.ts` and a new public method on `ServerManager`; a handful of new constants; 3–4 new test files with fixtures. Output mime coverage: `text/markdown`, `text/html`, `image/png` (direct + inside `application/vnd.marimo+mimebundle` + `<img src="data:">`), `text/plain`; ignore `<marimo-ui-element>`/`<marimo-*>`.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Language Division**: PASS — spec/plan/tasks/code/commits in English; user communication in Japanese.
- **II. Desktop-Only Architecture**: PASS — uses `child_process`/`fs`; no mobile APIs introduced. The live export runs JS in the existing Electron `<webview>` (already a desktop-only dependency of the plugin), consistent with this principle.
- **III. Reliable Process Lifecycle**: PASS — export runs a short-lived subprocess captured via the existing `runCapture` (spawn → exit), not a long-lived server; nothing new to tear down on unload.
- **IV. Safe Local Bindings**: N/A — export does not open a network server; it is a one-shot CLI invocation writing a local file. No token/port surface added.
- **V. Virtual Environment Preference**: PASS — export reuses `ServerManager.resolveCommand()`, which already prefers the vault `.venv` before PATH.
- **VI. Constant Externalization**: PASS (enforced in tasks) — all new literals (command ids/names, CLI args `export`/`html`/`--no-include-code`/`-o`, mime types, tag names, file suffixes, notices) defined in `src/constants.ts`. `tests/constants-policy.test.ts` guards this.
- **Core Constraints**: PASS — TypeScript only; no new bundled dependency; Node/Electron/Obsidian remain `external`; Tabs; existing comments preserved.

No violations. Complexity Tracking table omitted.

**Structure Decision**: Single-project layout (existing). Logic is split into two
**pure, dependency-free** modules (`marimo-mount-config.ts`, `html-to-markdown.ts`)
that are trivially unit-testable under the existing esbuild+`node --test` harness,
plus one **orchestration** module (`notebook-export.ts`) that touches the Obsidian
`Vault`/`FileManager`, `ServerManager.exportNotebookHtml()` (CLI fallback), and
`MarimoEditorView.exportLiveHtml()` (live session). `main.ts` wires the
commands/menu items, exposes `findOpenNotebookView()` to locate the running
editor, and calls the orchestrator. The live-export mechanism lives in
`editor-view.ts` (it owns the `<webview>`): an injected script captures the marimo
client's request headers so a later injected script can `POST /api/export/html`
with that session's identity. The conversion modules are agnostic to which source
produced the HTML.
